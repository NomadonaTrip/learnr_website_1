Design Principles
Comprehensive design checklist in /context/design-principles.md

Brand style guide in /context/style-guide.md

When making visual (front-end, UI/UX) changes, always refer to these files for guidance

Quick Visual Check
IMMEDIATELY after implementing any front-end change:

Identify what changed – Review the modified components/pages

Navigate to affected pages – Use mcp__playwright__browser_navigate to visit each changed view

Verify design compliance – Compare against /context/design-principles.md and /context/style-guide

Validate feature implementation – Ensure the change fulfills the user's specific request

Check acceptance criteria – Review any provided context files or requirements

Capture evidence – Take full page screenshot at desktop viewport (1440px) of each changed view

Check for errors – Run mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages

This verification ensures changes meet design standards and user requirements.
